## Course Overview

CS135 introduces students to the fundamentals of programming using C++ with the following learning objectives:

- Develop algorithmic solutions to problems and translate their algorithms into C++ programs that meet a set of specifications.
- Compile and execute their programs in the Linux operating environment and use appropriate testing and debugging strategies.
- Use appropriate control structures (sequence, selection, and iteration) in their programs.
- Develop modularized programs using functions and passing parameters.
- Use strings and file streams.
- Use one-dimensional arrays and records.
- Use good programming style and adequately document programs.
